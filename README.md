Background Knowledge

The crystal fountain uses a DMX-Generator which produces the DMX differential signals, this then travels to the DMX-Sender board through the XLR cables in which it is translated into single-ended signal for data in the module. The signal then travels to the DMX-Receiver board via the antennae. The receiver board then converts this single-ended signal back to differential using one the chips and then plugs it right back into the light, which results in the different light sequence based on what is being produced from the generator device.

Boards Needed 

Designing the boards can be quite an annoying process, however, I have designed these boards and they are available for download if needed.
